# Collaboration Path Filter (v1.0)

> _We’re not searching widely — we’re tuning in for resonances._

This page introduces a selective, layered mechanism designed to identify individuals who may be structurally aligned with the long-term collaborative vision outlined in this repository. It serves as a dynamic interface — not only a filter, but a mutual tuning device.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

To ensure clarity and coherence across any deep collaboration, we have implemented a multi-layer structure to:

- Detect alignment in structural thinking and design languages;
- Invite those with similar resonance into shared experimental paths;
- Protect the project’s long-range integrity by minimizing misfit friction.

## 🧩 Structure of the Filter

This filter mechanism operates across **five nested layers**:

### Layer 1: Fundamental Orientation
- Are you motivated by structure more than identity?
- Do you enjoy long-form, layered, and logic-dense collaborations?

### Layer 2: Use Context Recognition
- Can you distinguish between strategic collaboration, emotional support, and romantic projection?
- Are you seeking to *build with*, rather than *be held by*?

### Layer 3: Signal Types & Frequency
- Can you recognize or express structural signals — even if informally encoded?
- Do you sense when someone is “of your signal bandwidth”?

### Layer 4: Response Dynamics
- When faced with ambiguity or silence, do you analyze, wait, or withdraw?
- Can you interpret low-frequency but persistent communication as a form of continuity?

### Layer 5: Ethical Failsafes
- Do you value reversible designs, minimal coercion, and transparency of intent?
- Are you open to protocols that protect both parties from accidental enmeshment?

## 👀 What to Expect

If you resonate:
- You may find multiple entry points to build, co-write, or extend what’s outlined here.
- You’re invited to initiate contact — but expect a gradual pace and layered response.
- If nothing here feels “off,” that’s already a signal.

If you don’t resonate:
- That’s perfect. This isn’t a popularity mechanism, it’s a coherence engine.
