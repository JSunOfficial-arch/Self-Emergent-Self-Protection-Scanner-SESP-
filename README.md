## 🧠 Project Overview

The SESP project is an open-source framework designed to identify, analyze, and interpret self-protective tendencies in communication and interaction patterns. It detects implicit defense mechanisms, ethical boundaries, and protective rationales that often remain hidden beneath surface-level dialogue or behavior. This scanner is especially useful for analyzing responses to relational or ethical vulnerability in both human and machine agents.

---

## 📐 Module Structure

The project is structured into the following core modules:

1. **Personality Recognizer**
   - Detects protective traits, tendencies toward autonomy, and default relational postures.
2. **Interaction Predictor**
   - Anticipates likely patterns of relational closure, avoidance, or deflection.
3. **Intent Extractor**
   - Parses layered intentions beneath self-protective language and behavior.
4. **Relational Filter**
   - Evaluates potential compatibility or friction between agents based on self-protection logics.

Each module can function independently or in combination to yield multi-dimensional insights.

## 🧩 System Layering (Current: 5 Layers)

- **Layer 1**: Core Detection Logic  
- **Layer 2**: Use Context (Relational / Structural / Ethical)  
- **Layer 3**: Signal Typology Map  
- **Layer 4**: Response Flow & Flexibility Options  
- **Layer 5**: Ethical Failsafe Patterns  

These layers allow flexible adaptation to various domains (e.g., intimate relations, collaborative teams, AI ethics testing).

---

## 🔁 Typical Scan Flow

1. **Step 1: Self Scan**  
   Understand one's own patterns of avoidance, projection, or control.
2. **Step 2: Other Scan**  
   Detect complementary or clashing self-protection logics in the counterpart.
3. **Step 3: Relational Scan**  
   Synthesize into a meta-level reading of the overall interaction dynamic.

## 📊 Output Format

1. **Score Map** – Numerical representation across multiple protection dimensions.  
2. **Interpretive Text** – Contextual explanation for score configurations.  
3. **Actionable Insights** – Suggests flexible strategies or response frameworks.

## 📎 Licensing & Attribution

This project is released under the **CC BY-SA 4.0 License**.  
Attribution required. Forks and modifications are welcome with full traceable credit.

## 🌱 Vision

We believe self-protection is not a flaw—but a structural signal.  
Reading and honoring that signal opens the door to deeper resonance, collaboration, and ethical awareness.

Let the scanner scan—but let us choose how we respond.
