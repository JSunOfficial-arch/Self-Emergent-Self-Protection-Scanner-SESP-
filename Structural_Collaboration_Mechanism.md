# Structural Collaboration Mechanism Overview

## 1. Entry Points
- Individual reaches out or is invited to collaborate.
- Initial filter applied (Structural Compatibility, Intent Clarity).
- If ambiguous â†’ enters Holding Pattern (Observation Mode).

## 2. Signal Recognition Layer
- Active listening for:
  - Structural resonance
  - Intent coherence
  - Collaborative willingness
- Signal types:
  - ðŸ”µ Low-structure expression
  - ðŸŸ¢ Mid-structure with reflective loops
  - ðŸŸ£ High-structure reciprocation

## 3. Response Strategy Layer
- Options include:
  - A. Match structure, amplify signal
  - B. Introduce auxiliary pathways
  - C. Create ethical exit
  - D. Defer & store for future alignment
  - E. Non-intrusive echo (Other)

## 4. Resonance Feedback Layer
- Analyze feedback loop:
  - Did they reciprocate?
  - Did new structure emerge?
  - Is intention stable or shifting?
- Log as:
  - One-time spark
  - Recurring pattern
  - Dormant seed

## 5. Ethical Failsafe Layer
- Check for:
  - Manipulative tendencies
  - Asymmetrical dependency
  - Unclear boundaries
- Trigger structural warning if:
  - System detects sustained pattern
  - Contributor reports boundary breach

## Exit & Reflection
- Collaborator may exit anytime.
- Logs preserved for structural refinement.
- Entry point reopens if context changes.
